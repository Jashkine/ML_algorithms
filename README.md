# Machine Learning Algorithms

## Overview

This repository provides implementations of machine learning algorithms. It includes algorithms for both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. Each implementation is constructed from scratch to ensure a deeper understanding of the underlying principles. The goal is to offer clear, accessible code that demonstrates how these algorithms work in practice.
